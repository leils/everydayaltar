My community gives me something that can't be bought, which is a place that is both accepting and challenging. It gives me people to hold and be held by, people to challenge my ideas and values, people to make me think just a little bit harder. My community gives me love."

I have no recipes from him, but apparently he could cook anything. It was his great joy. Alongside cooking he liked gambling. He passed soon after his wife did."

            "response": "My drink of choice is coffee. I've been drinking coffee since I was 12, for late-nighters doing homework. My drink of choices is also a tonic and bitters with lime, because I stopped drinking a while back and that's almost always available. I turn bright red when I drink, but that's really not the worst part; my immune system launches an all-out response and I fall back into my itchy, unhappy ways. "

            "response": "One small ritual is that I always take off my shoes before entering. It's a motion about germs and dirt, but it's also a motion about respect; respecting the house too much to step on it. "

            "response": "When I was very young, my grandmother taught me how to paint a bird. We had some language barrier, so she taught me through her motions. She had a little sheet of paper with the painting step by step, and led me through it, showing me first how to paint the body, then the wing, then the head, each a separate stroke. I still have that slip of paper. "
