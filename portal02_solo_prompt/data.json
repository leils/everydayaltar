            "response": "My drink of choice is coffee. I've been drinking coffee since I was 12, for late-nighters doing homework. My drink of choices is also a tonic and bitters with lime, because I stopped drinking a while back and that's almost always available. I turn bright red when I drink, but that's really not the worst part; my immune system launches an all-out response and I fall back into my itchy, unhappy ways. "
