    "Write about something your community gives you.": [
        "My community gives me a place to call mine, even for a little bit. My community gives me something that can't be bought, which is a place that is both accepting and challenging. It gives me people to hold and be held by, people to challenge my ideas and values, people to make me think just a little bit harder. My community gives me love."
    ],
    "Tell me about your community.": [
        "My community is a group of incredibly interesting people. They're a group of people who have co come together across the world to a singular place to look at what it means to create art and make things that wow and delight."

    "Write about an ancestor.": [
        "My mother's father was apparently a great cook. He and my grandmother owned a restaurant in Utah, and little more. My mom learned to cook by watching him. I have no recipes from him, but apparently he could cook anything. It was his great joy. Alongside cooking he liked gambling. He passed soon after his wife did."
    ],
    "What is an ancestor.": [
        "An ancestor is someone that has formed your living being. It's someone that you look back onto your lineage and see their fingerprints. It may have something to do with blood, or it may have nothing to do with blood. Ancestry is a way of being carried."

    "What's your drink of choice?": [
        "My drink of choice is coffee. I've been drinking coffee since I was 12, for late-nighters doing homework. My drink of choices is also a tonic and bitters with lime, because I stopped drinking a while back and that's almost always available. I turn bright red when I drink, but that's really not the worst part; my immune system launches an all-out response and I fall back into my itchy, unhappy ways. ",
        "In the morning, it's coffee. I've been drinking coffee since I was 12, when my mom would bring me half-cups to help me g get through all-nighters. Now I mostly make my own, with a pourover cone and some fresh beans. But my parents used to make what they called \"cowboy coffee\", just boiling the grounds over the stove."

    "Write about a family member.": [
        "My mom came to the United States when she was 7. She didn't speak any English, but she learned quickly because she had to take care of her family.",
        "My dad is a funny man. He is incredibly smart, incredibly handy. I think he's fixed almost every part of the hous the car, the water heating system. He used to be a software engineer in security. He grew up in Taiwan, and came to the United States to get a college degree.",
        "My mom loves to garden. She's growing a bunch of her own food in the front yard, where they've removed all the grass for a drought-tolerant vegetable and herb garden. She's a whiz with plants, gcrowing tomatoes out of her ears and always using her herbs in her cooking.",
        "My mother's mother lived in Utah, the same place she and her family immigrated from Canton to. I hear little about her from my family, other than she suffered from schitzofrenia and other maladies. She was a \"hard woman\". She spoke little english and relied on my mother for translation. She passed due to complications from chemotherapy."

    "What's a ritual that exists around your home?": [
        "One small ritual is that I always take off my shoes before entering. It's a motion about germs and dirt, but it's also a motion about respect; respecting the house too much to step on it. "
    ],
    "What's a moment you remember that is important to you?": [
        "When I was a kid, I stole a set of crayon pencils from my cousin. He had been mean to me over and over before, and this time had been strangely nice, letting me draw with his paper and pens. I stole the crayons in retribution, hiding them in my shirt. ",
        "When I was very young, my grandmother taught me how to paint a bird. We had some language barrier, so she taught me through her motions. She had a little sheet of paper with the painting step by step, and led me through it, showing me first how to paint the body, then the wing, then the head, each a separate stroke. I still have that slip of paper. "

    "What do you eat when you're stressed?": [
        "When I'm stressed, I eat potato chips. A lot of different ones, from honey dijon to sour cream and onion, but particuularly Pringles. Pringles sour cream and onion chips are excellent stress-eats, and can be found almost anywhere, and come in the most portable container you can find for last-minute pack-and-go rushing. "

    "Write about a memory you have of family.": [
        "A couple of years ago, after a Thanksgiving gathering, my family and I went out Black Friday shopping. My parents don't really shop much, but we went because the whole extended family went. I got caught up trying to figure out if I wanted to buy this leather jacket or not. I paced, and debated, and thought hard. My mom said I should just get it, because it wasn't worth thinking this hard about. My dad said I shouldn't get it, because it's expensive and it would mean more to find a good jacket at the thrift store. In the end I bought it.",
        "When I was a little kid, I was still the oldest of my cousins on my mom's side. We were having a gathering at our house, and all the little kids were rushing up and down the stairs, riding them like we could surf on our asses. I remember all the adults, yelling at us from the dining table, saying we were gonna make ourselves sick. A couple of rounds later, someone did get sick. It was me. I vomited onto the floor, and all the sliding stopped then and there.",
        "When we moved into the house my family lives in now, it was absolutely gutted. We redid the whole thing ourselves, from laying laminate tile in the kitchen to paving the back yard. I remember being not much more than 5, and carrying pavers in from the front yard to the back with my mom. She'd carry 4 or 5, I'd carry 1, and we'd load them into my little red flyer wheelbarrow."

    "Write about your hobbies.": [
        "I do too many hobbies. One of my hobbies is knitting. I learned to knit from my grandmother, who was an absolute whiz at it. She would make jumpers and vests and blankets, all in stitches that I still don't understand today. Today I make a lot of socks, and I've made exactly one lumpy sweater."
    ],
    "Do you have a nighttime habit? Write about it.": [
        "At night, I read. Not exactly books or novels all the time, but I always end up reading something, whether it's comics or webtoons or a chapter of something I'm excited about. "
    ],
    "What do you do to unwind?": [
        "A lot of the time now, I watch things on YouTube or TikTok. But honestly, that doesn't really feel like unwinding. When I'm really  relaxing, I'm taking the time to knit, or cook some food for myself and friends.  When I'm truly vegging out, I'll pick up a new video game and play it for days, something I never got to do as a kid. "
    ],
    "Where do you go to relax?": [
        "To relax, I go to the park. I take my time walking around, looking at the grass and the trees, watching the people go by."

    "What's a treasured posession of yours?": [
        "The painted rock some friends gave me for Valentine's day in high school",
        "I have this oil lamp that I got in France, from my first trip to Europe. I grew up not getting souvenirs, so this is one of my first ones. It was by a local potter who was making dozens of these, and I asked for the very lamp that was lit in the window as I walked by. It took so much packaging to get it home safely, but now I light it whenever I need a little extra light, and I love it dearly. "

    "Do you have a favorite plant/animal": [
        "I do have a fav animal which is a deer. If we were in a \"Harry Potter\" movie, \"deer\" could be my \"patronum\"",
        "My favorite animal is the raccoon. I think it would be cute yet daunting to have a pet that has apposable thumbs. But they're so cute and some are domesticated which gives me hope that maybe one day I can have a raccoon.",
        "i never had a pet growing up and it made me feel like my family might have been less kind than others. there was a practical and clinicalness to the choicce which made sense to me, and though i didn't want a pet, it seems to have informed me in a way. "
