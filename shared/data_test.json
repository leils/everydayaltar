        "I do have a fav animal which is a deer. If we were in a \"Harry Potter\" movie, \"deer\" could be my \"patronum\"",
        "My favorite animal is the raccoon. I think it would be cute yet daunting to have a pet that has apposable thumbs. But they're so cute and some are domesticated which gives me hope that maybe one day I can have a raccoon.",
        "i never had a pet growing up and it made me feel like my family might have been less kind than others. there was a practical and clinicalness to the choicce which made sense to me, and though i didn't want a pet, it seems to have informed me in a way. "

    "What's a treasured posession of yours?": [
        "I have this oil lamp that I got in France, from my first trip to Europe. I grew up not getting souvenirs, so this is one of my first ones. It was by a local potter who was making dozens of these, and I asked for the very lamp that was lit in the window as I walked by. It took so much packaging to get it home safely, but now I light it whenever I need a little extra light, and I love it dearly. "
