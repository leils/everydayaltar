        "My favorite animal is the raccoon. I think it would be cute yet daunting to have a pet that has apposable thumbs. But they're so cute and some are domesticated which gives me hope that maybe one day I can have a raccoon.",
        "i never had a pet growing up and it made me feel like my family might have been less kind than others. there was a practical and clinicalness to the choicce which made sense to me, and though i didn't want a pet, it seems to have informed me in a way. "
