My community gives me something that can't be bought, which is a place that is both accepting and challenging. It gives me people to hold and be held by, people to challenge my ideas and values, people to make me think just a little bit harder. My community gives me love."

My drink of choices is also a tonic and bitters with lime, because I stopped drinking a while back and that's almost always available. I turn bright red when I drink, but that's really not the worst part; my immune system launches an all-out response and I fall back into my itchy, unhappy ways. "
